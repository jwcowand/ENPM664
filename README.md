In order to run the demo of this project, you must have a Windows 32 bit. You can utilize a VM for this if you don't have one.
After you are on Windows 32-bit, go to http://thesiteformerlyknownas.zachtronicsindustries.com/ruckingenur-editor/ and download the ruckingenur editor.
In the same file location of the ruckingenur editor .exe file, place all my files.
Then run the editor and open my .ruck file using the navigation bar at the top, then hit "run" in the top navigation bar once my .ruck file opens.
